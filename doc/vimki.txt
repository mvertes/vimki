==============================================================================
1. Vimki Installation                                     *vimki-install*

    |wimki| should work with Vim 6.0 or later versions. |vimki| should install
    with any of existing plugin manager.

    For example, using vim-plug: >
    	Plug 'mvertes/vimki'
<
    |vimki| may be customized by setting variables, creating maps,
    and specifying event handlers.  Please see |vimki-customize| for
    more details.

==============================================================================
2. vimki intro                                                   *vimki*
                                                       *wiki*  *vimki-intro*

   vimki provides functions and mappings for maintaining a Wiki of plain
   text files.

   The Wiki is a collection of text files in a single directory. These
   files can contain hyper links to each other in the form of WikiWords.

   A WikiWord is a word which starts with an upper case letter and contains
   at least one lower case letter and another upper case letter in this
   order -- it's in 'camel case', e.g.

     ThisIsAWikiWord

   Such a WikiWord links to a file of exactly the same name in your
   Wiki directory.

   By default you can also use digits and underscore in your WikiWords.
   You can customize this to your needs. |vimki-customize|

   When opening a Wiki file vimki scans your Wiki directory to find
   which WikiWords are valid links. WikiWords without a corresponding
   file are highlighted as errors (otherwise it doesn't matter).

   The default mappings are defined as follow (by default, <Leader>
   stands for '\'. See |Leader| for more info) :

   <Leader>ww   - open the Wiki HomePage
   <Leader>wi   - open the Wiki index
   <Leader>wf   - follow a WikiWord (can be used in any buffer!)
   <Leader>we   - edit a Wiki file

   The following mappings are present when editing a Wiki file:

   <Leader><Leader> - close the file
   <CR>             - follow the WikiWord under the cursor
   <Tab>            - move to the next WikiWord
   <BS>             - move to the previous WikiWord
   <Leader>wr       - reload WikiWords

   See |vimki-mappings-override| and |vimki-options| to learn how to
   override those default mappings.

==============================================================================
3. vimki commands	                                     *vimki-commands*

    See |vimki-intro| for default mapping.

    Currently vimki does not define any commands.

==============================================================================
4. vimki customization                                       *vimki-customize*

4.1. General configuration      ~
--------------------------
                                               *vimki_loaded*  *vimki-disable*
    You can disable this script by putting the following line in your
    |vimrc|: >
      let vimki_loaded = 1
<

    You can define your own color scheme for vimki highlighting, by
    setting |highlight| on VimkiWord and VimkiWordNotFound groups.
    For example:
>
      highlight VimkiWord          guifg=darkcyan
      highlight VimkiWordNotFound  guibg=Red guifg=Yellow
<
    When a wiki file is edited the 'filetype' and 'syntax' options
    are set to 'vimki'. You can use autocommands for this filetype to
    customize your wiki editing. For exmaple:
>
      :au Filetype vimki set sts=4
<
    If you want to be able to switch the highlighting on and off with
>
      :syntax on | enable | off
<

4.2. Mapping documentation:      ~
---------------------------
                                                   *vimki-mappings-override*
    By default, a global mapping is defined for some commands.
    User-provided mappings can be used instead by mapping to
    <Plug>CommandName. This is especially useful when these mappings
    collide with other existing mappings (vim will warn of this during
    plugin initialization, but will not clobber the existing mappings).

    For instance, to override the default mapping for :VimkiHome to set
    it to \wh, add the following to the |vimrc|:
>
      nmap \wh <Plug>VimkiHome
<
4.3. Options documentation:      ~
---------------------------
                                                             *vimki-options*
    Several variables are checked by the script to customize vimki
    behavior. You can set them using let in your |vimrc| file.
    Example:
>
        let vimki_home = "$HOME/MyWiki/HomePage"
<
    vimki_suffix                                            *vimki_suffix*
      This variable contains a suffix appended to the names of your
      Wikifiles. Default: ''

    vimki_home                                                *vimki_home*
      This variable contains the filename of your Wiki HomePage.
      Default: $HOME/Wiki/HomePage + vimki_suffix

    vimki_home_dir                                        *vimki_home_dir*
      This variable contains the path of your Wiki directory.
      Default: the directory containing the file set in vimki_home.

    vimki_upper                                              *vimki_upper*
      Upper case characters for WikiWords. Uses the syntax of [ ] atoms
      in regular expressions. 
      Default: 'A-Z'

    vimki_lower                                              *vimki_lower*
      Lower case characters for WikiWords. Uses the syntax of [ ] atoms
      in regular expressions. 
      Default: 'a-z'

    vimki_other                                              *vimki_other*
      Non-letter characters for WikiWords. Uses the syntax of [ ] atoms
      in regular expressions. 
      Default: '0-9_'

    vimki_autowrite                                      *vimki_autowrite*
      If this is non-zero vimki always writes a Wiki file when it
      is closed by <Plug>VimkiClose or when you follow another WikiWord.
      (the file is only written if it has been changed.)

    vimki_ignore                                            *vimki_ignore*
      A comma-separated list of words you don't want vimki to
      highlight. Don't include any whitespace in this list.
      Default: ''
