vim :heart: wiki = vimki
========================

If you use Vim and like to keep notes as text files, then you should
like this simple plugin.

Vimki allows to browse, navigate and edit a collection of text files in
a single directory (usually `~/Wiki`). These files contain hyperlinks to
each other in the form of [WikiWords], as in the original [WikiWikiWeb].

Installation
------------

Vimki should install with your favorite package manager.
For example, using [vim-plug], add `Plug 'mvertes/vimki'` 
in your `~/.vimrc` and in vim run `:PlugInstall`.
