vim :heart: wiki = vimki
========================

If you use Vim and like to keep notes as text files, then you should
like this simple plugin.

Vimki allows to browse, navigate and edit a collection of text files in
a single directory. These files contain hyperlinks to each other in the
form of [WikiWords].

Installation
------------

wimki should work with Vim 7 or later versions. vimki should install
with any of existing vim plugin manager. For example, using [vim-plug]:

```vim
Plug 'mvertes/vimki'
```

On Vim version 8 or higher, you can use the built-in package management
instead (see `:help packages` for more information). Just run this command
in your terminal:

```console
git clone https://github.com/mvertes/vimki ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/vimki
```
